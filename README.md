You are tasked with designing a database to manage the administration of the "Database Fiesta" contest, where students from higher learning institutions or secondary schools can register in groups of three to four members, with a mentor advising each group. Each student is identified by a unique ID and has relevant details such as name, telephone number, and email. Mentors, who can advise up to three groups, are associated with their name, telephone number, and institution or school. Institutions or schools, each identified by an ID, name, and address (street, city, postcode, state), may have one or more student groups registered. The database will track group registrations, which include the registration date, category and group members' details. Each student group creates one poster for the contest, which is assigned an ID, title, and description. The posters are evaluated by two judges, each with an ID, name, affiliation (organization), and email, with their organization details stored as well (including organization ID, name, and address). Each judge can evaluate up to ten posters, assessing them based on six aspects: Coverage of the Topic, Use of Graphics, Organization, Layout and Design, Mechanics, and Comprehension. The database will store the total marks and results for each poster, allowing for the selection of first, second, and third place winners in each category based on the combined scores from both judges.
